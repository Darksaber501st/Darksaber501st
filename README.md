- 👋 Hi, I’m @Darksaber501st, an engineer working mostly on sustainable water resources management projects in central Florida
- 👀 I’m interested in ... everything! I love to fiddle and learn all sorts of bits of coding, big-data, etc. I've worked on geospatial remote-sensing, full-stack development, VR experiences, large-scale hydrological modeling, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... most recent "new" thing has been the VR stuff in Unity 3D, coupling that with my groundwater modeling that I'm doing my Ph.D. on. Most recent "expansion" thing has been developing a series of utilities to procedurally build, run, and process the results the massive grounwater models I have and render output into something viewable and understandable using geospatial tools like ArcGIS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything! Particularly projects related to environmental protection, land-use change, water resouces, resouce management, etc.
- 📫 How to reach me ... if you need to know, you know. ;-)
