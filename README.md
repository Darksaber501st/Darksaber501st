- 👋 Hi, I’m @Darksaber501st, an engineer working mostly on sustainable water resources management projects in central Florida
- 👀 I’m interested in ... everything! I love to fiddle and learn all sorts of bits of coding, big-data, etc. I've worked on geospatial remote-sensing, full-stack development, VR experiences, large-scale hydrological modeling, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... most recently has been the VR stuff in Unity 3D, coupling that with my groundwater modeling that I'm doing my Ph.D. on.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything! Particularly projects related to environmental protection, land-use change, water resouces, resouce management, etc.
- 📫 How to reach me ... if you need to know, you know. ;-)
