- 👋 Hi, I’m @Darksaber501st, an engineer working mostly on sustainable resources management projects around the US (my background is hydrology)
- 👀 I’m interested in ... everything! I love to fiddle and learn all sorts of bits of coding, big-data, etc. I've worked on geospatial remote-sensing, full-stack development, VR experiences, large-scale hydrological modeling, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... most recent "new" thing has been procesing some GCM outputs for my clients so they can plug them into their models & simulations. Also some VR stuff in Unity 3D. Most recent "expansion" thing has been continued growth in building groundwater modeling tools specific to my job so I can take more naps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything! Particularly projects related to environmental protection, land-use change, water resouces, resouce management, etc.- 📫 How to reach me ... if you need to know, you know. ;-)
